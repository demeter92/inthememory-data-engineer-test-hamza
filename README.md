In case of problemen when running spark  linked to the syntax of the files spark-master.sh and spark-worker.sh, 
please make sure tthe end line is LF and not CRLF. It may cause problem.


Problems when handling transactions table :
- Comments on some input files starting with #
- The id of client was not unique so duplicates in table transactions avec la jointure (26 transactions concern√©s)
- Sometimes the date was not good so i make sure to get the date from the file name
- This was a problem on my side about a regex which made not get the date in some files


Added column :
I added the file ingestion_ts for the needs of the audit
